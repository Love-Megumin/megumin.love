        <h2 style="text-align: center">TLDR: Due to domain/hosting funding, <b>this site will most likely shut down by the 28th October of 2025</b>. If you'd like to prevent that through taking over hosting the site, contact me via <a href="mailto:megumin(emailsymbol)robflop(dotto)me?subject=megumin.love Maintenance">E-Mail</a>.</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In May of 2025, it'll have been 9 years since I wrote the very first bits of code for this website, which was actually my very first coding project ever. At first, a kind friend let me host it on their server, when it was still a static page.</p>
        <p>Later, I found an at the time incredibly cheap hosting company at which I could get 2 years worth for next to nothing, making it affordable even to my school self back then. Then, at one point, I referred two or three friends to the same company, and due to their also at the time incredibly generous referral program, gained enough credits to keep the server running since.</p>
        <p>The credits I gained then finally, after many years, ran out in July of 2022, when I last renewed the server for 2 more years (until October 2025). In the time since I first put up the website and now, the provider has gone through several price increases, bringing them from the previously incredibly cheap offerings to ones that are more in line with the usual you would expect.</p>
        <p>Now, the next renewal is slated for the 28th October of 2025. However, this is now money that would have to paid fully out of my own pocket, as I've never taken donations or the like for this site. While I've always paid the domain costs out of my own pocket from the start, the upcoming hosting costs added onto that are an expense I don't really want to carry, especially since I am as of yet still in university.</p>
        <p><b>Therefore, if you are interested in taking over hosting for this website, please contact me via <a href="mailto:megumin(emailsymbol)robflop(dotto)me?subject=megumin.love Maintenance">E-Mail</a>. I would be sending you the database file, give instructions on how to run the site etc. (it's very, very simple) and look into how to transfer the domain to you, with details discussed where required. You would henceforth also have to renew the domain alongside hosting the site.</b></p>
        <p>As I don't use any traffic analysis tools (like Google Analytics), I don't actually know how many people still visit the site aside from seeing how many clicks are made on the main page through the built-in click statistics, but it would be nice if it could keep running regardless, given that it's been running for this long already. I may potentially pick hosting back up much later down the line once I finish university and start a job, but I do not know that yet.</p>
