Some soundclips that used to be on the website are no longer included by default.

As some may want to keep them, their original mp3 files are being stored in the [sound_archive](https://github.com/robflop/megumin.love/tree/master/sound_archive) folder in the repo.

Their source information (Season, Episode, Timestamp) are kept in the [Soundclip sources](https://github.com/robflop/megumin.love/wiki/Soundclip-sources) wiki page, under the "Archived" section.
